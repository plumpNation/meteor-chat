meteor-chat
===========

Based on a tutorial

http://sebastiandahlgren.se/2013/07/17/tutorial-writing-your-first-metor-application/

I'm trying to create a commandline IRC experience in the browser and learn a little bit about Meteor
in the process.

```SHELL
# install meteor
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
# install meteorite
sudo -H npm install -g meteorite

# clone this repo
git clone [this repo]

cd meteor-chat
# start the meteor development server via meteorite
mrt
```
